		<p>A soft breeze drifted through the open window, carrying the faint scent of rain on distant pavement. Inside the quiet room, a small lamp flickered gently, casting warm shadows that danced along the walls. Somewhere outside, a lone bicycle bell chimed, its sound echoing like a brief reminder of life beyond the stillness. For a moment, everything felt suspended—time, thought, even the air itself—inviting anyone who noticed to pause and simply breathe.
		The old train station stood at the edge of the town, its rusted tracks disappearing into a curtain of overgrown grass. Travelers rarely passed through anymore, yet the benches still held the memory of countless stories whispered between departures and arrivals. On quiet afternoons, sunlight streamed through the cracked windows, illuminating dust particles that floated like tiny worlds in motion. It was a place forgotten by many, but for those who wandered in, it felt like stepping into a fragment of time that refused to fade.</p>
